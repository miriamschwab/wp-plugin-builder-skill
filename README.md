# WordPress Plugin Builder — Claude Code Skill

A Claude Code skill that enforces WordPress plugin development standards. Built from real plugin projects submitted to WP.org — every pattern in this skill was learned the hard way.

## What this is

A [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) — a markdown file that teaches Claude how to build WordPress plugins correctly. When installed, Claude automatically follows these standards whenever you're working on a WordPress plugin.

## What it covers

- **Plugin header** — every required and recommended field, with rules for setting `Requires at least` and `Requires PHP` based on actual code
- **File structure** — standard layout for WP.org-ready plugins
- **Prefixing** — consistent namespacing for functions, classes, constants, hooks, and option keys
- **Internationalization (i18n)** — translation function patterns and text domain rules
- **Output escaping** — `esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses_post` at the point of output
- **Nonces** — CSRF protection for forms and AJAX
- **Prepared SQL** — `$wpdb->prepare()` patterns for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and table creation with `dbDelta()`
- **readme.txt** — WP.org directory listing format with all required fields
- **Plugin Check (PCP)** — how to run it and the most common failure points to pre-empt
- **Activation, deactivation, uninstall hooks** — lifecycle management with schema version upgrades
- **REST API** — `permission_callback`, input sanitization via `args`, capability checks
- **Block editor compatibility** — enqueue on the right hooks, don't break Gutenberg
- **Object caching** — `wp_cache_get/set` vs transients, cache invalidation patterns
- **Multisite** — `get_site_option`, network capability checks, per-site table prefixes
- **Privacy (GDPR)** — personal data export and erasure hooks
- **CDN caching gotchas** — workarounds for managed hosts that ignore `?ver=` cache busters
- **Settings API** — options pages, sanitize callbacks, and matching option groups
- **Cron and scheduled tasks** — scheduling, clearing, idempotency, and manual triggers
- **Debugging checklist** — the usual "it doesn't work" causes and where to look first
- **Security guards and input normalization** — why a guard must normalize input the same way the code it protects does, including case-insensitive REST route matching and `sanitize_key()` behaviour
- **Settings and caching traps** — checkbox absence on non-form writes, cache invalidation from settings, number-input `step` blocking a save
- **Testing what local gates can't** — reading another plugin's data, PHPStan errors in tests, audit stages that crash silently, degradation budgets
- **Specs and protocols** — checking what real consumers read, answering each protocol version in its own shape, PHP's renaming of dotted parameter names
- **WebMCP in Chrome** — the API surface, result and annotation rules, and how to test in a real browser
- **WordPress and hosting quirks** — the WordPress 7.0 admin excerpt length, managed hosts that redirect missing `.js` files, sanitizing data from other plugins, filtering bundled IP lists, reducing IPv6 addresses correctly

## Skills
- See `.claude/skills/wp-plugin-builder.md` for WordPress plugin development standards
```

Claude Code will automatically load the skill when working in your project directory.

## Usage

Once installed, Claude will automatically apply these standards when:
- You ask it to build a new WordPress plugin
- You're editing plugin PHP files
- You ask about REST endpoints, admin pages, or plugin packaging
- You're preparing a plugin for WP.org submission
- You're doing version bumps, security reviews, or PCP compliance checks

## Origin

Built and maintained by [Miriam Schwab](https://miriamschwab.me), refined across multiple WordPress plugin projects including plugins published on WordPress.org. Every rule and pattern in this skill was discovered through real development — bugs found, reviews failed, workarounds proven.
